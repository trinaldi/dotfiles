# Use the Xinerama extension instead of RandR for multi-monitor support.

# is connected or disconnected which might break follow mode if the screen

# * open_url: If the notification has exactly one url, open it. If there are multiple
#             ones, open the context menu.
# * close_current: Close current notification.
# * close_all: Close all notifications.
# * context: Open context menu for the notification.
# * context_all: Open context menu for all notifications.
# These values can be strung together for each mouse event, and
# will be executed in sequence.
